### Usage

1. All the files from .github folder should be copied to the same location in target repository
2. Pipeline is running only on release branch and hotfix branch (changes of changelog.md file are not triggering the pipeline second time)
3. Version is taken from branch name of release (ex. release/0.2.3 the Version in changelog will be 0.2.3)
4. .github/config/config.yaml should be configured accordigly with the project.
